\section*{Introduction}

\noindent
The exam will be ``closed notes'' and ``closed book'' and it will cover the
following materials. Please review the ``Course Schedule'' on the Web site for
the course to see the content and slides that we have covered to this date.
Students may post questions about this material to our Slack team.

\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Chapters One through Seven in FWD, all sections (see online schedule for
    complete details).

  \item Using the commands in the terminal window (e.g., \program{cd} and
    \program{ls}); creating and viewing web sites with Markdown, HTML, and CSS;
    knowledge of the commands for using \program{git} and GitHub.

  \item All of your class notes and the discussion slides available from the
    course web site.

  \item Source code and writing for laboratory assignments 1--7 and practical
    assignments 1--6.

\end{itemize}

\noindent The exam will be a mix of questions that have a form such as fill in
the blank, short answer, true/false, and/or completion. The emphasis will be on
the following key topics:

\vspace*{-.05in}
\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Web development concepts and the Markdown, HTML, and CSS (e.g., key
    definitions).

  \item Practical laboratory techniques (e.g., creating, debugging, and viewing
    web sites; effectively using files and directories; correctly using GitHub
    through the command-line {\tt git} program).

  \item Understanding and fixing Web sites (e.g., given a short, perhaps even
    one line, source code segment written in Markdown, HTML, and/or CSS,
    understand what it does and be able to precisely describe its resulting
    output as evident in the web server logs or in the web browser).

  \item Programming Markdown, HTML, and/or CSS statements in a web site, given a
    description of a site's appearance and behavior. Students should be
    completely comfortable with writing short source code statements that are in
    a nearly correct form. While your web site may contain small syntactic
    errors, it is not acceptable to ``make up'' features of the Markdown, HTML,
    and CSS programming language that do not currently exist. Given a source
    code segment you should also be able to sketch what a web site would look
    like in a web browser.

\end{itemize}

\noindent No partial credit will be given for questions that are true/false,
completion, or fill in the blank. Minimal partial credit may be awarded for the
questions that require a student to write a short answer. You are strongly
encouraged to write short, precise, and correct responses to all of the
questions. When you are taking the exam, you should do so as a ``point
maximizer'' who first responds to the questions that you are most likely to
answer correctly for full points. Please keep the time limitation in mind as you
are absolutely required to submit the examination at the end of the class period
unless you have written permission for extra time from a member of the Learning
Commons. Students who do not submit their exam on time will have their overall
point total reduced. Finally, students may only reschedule the exam for a
different date or time if they are facing documented extenuating circumstances
that prevent them from attending the scheduled time slot. Please see the course
instructor if you have questions about any of these policies.

\section*{Reminder Concerning the Honor Code}

\noindent Students are required to fully adhere to the Honor Code during the
completion of this exam. More details about the Allegheny College Honor Code are
provided on the syllabus. Students are strongly encouraged to carefully review
the full statement of the Honor Code before taking this exam. If you do not
understand Allegheny College's Honor Code, then please schedule a meeting with
the course instructor. The following is a review of the Honor Code statement
from the course syllabus:

\begin{quote}
The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and
the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work
under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has
acknowledged the following pledge:
\end{quote}

\vspace*{-.15in}

\begin{quote}
  I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
  the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
  community as a whole.
\end{quote}

\section*{Detailed Review of Content}

The listing of topics in the following subsections is not exhaustive; rather, it
serves to illustrate the types of concepts that students should study as they
prepare for the examination. It is important to note that, by design, there is a
significant overlap in technical topics between this examination and the prior
mastery quiz. Please see the course instructor during office hours or a class
