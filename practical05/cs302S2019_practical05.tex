\section*{Objectives}

To continue to learn how to use GitHub to access the files for a practical
assignment. Additionally, to keep learning how to use the Ubuntu operating
system and programs such as a ``terminal window'', the Atom and GVim text
editors, and linting tools. You will also continue to practice using Slack to
support communication with the teaching assistants and the course instructor.
Next, you will practice fixing HTML and CSS files with content that incorrectly
creates and styles tabular data. In addition to using the grading tool to assess
your progress towards correctly completing the project, you will continue to run
a web server and use its output to diagnose source code problems.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Use the laboratory computers}. The computers in this laboratory feature specialized software for completing
  this course's laboratory and practical assignments. If it is necessary for you to work on a different machine, be sure
  to regularly transfer your work to a laboratory machine so that you can check its correctness. If you cannot use a
  laboratory computer and you need help with the configuration of your own laptop, then please carefully explain its
  setup to a teaching assistant or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a teaching assistant or instructor what assignment
  step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the start of a laboratory or practical session
  and then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can
  post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with a teaching assistant or
  the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Continuing with this laboratory assignment, you will be responsible for storing
  all of your files (e.g., JavaScript code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub Classroom.
  Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that
  everything is updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established correctness requirements by
  using the provided checking tools on your local computer and in checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files, and written reports after you submit them
  through GitHub; you will need them again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. All of your files are regularly backed-up to the servers in the Department of
  Computer Science and, if you commit your files regularly, stored on GitHub. However, you may want to use a flash
  drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep an extra copy of your files on reserve. In the event of
  any type of system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have access to a recent backup copy of all your
  files.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the laboratory assignments will be challenging
  for you, each part is designed to give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of computer
  science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed at a wide variety of companies. To explore and
  develop new ideas, you should regularly communicate with your team and/or the teaching assistants and tutors.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments require to you write technical
  documentation and descriptions of your experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct, remembering that computer scientists must
  effectively communicate and collaborate with their team members and the tutors, teaching assistants, and course
  instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your assignments with others, copying source
  code or writing is a violation of Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub
Guides'', available at \url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use
many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that
you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub''; each of them will help you to understand how to use both
GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this assignment, you should also read
Chapters 1 through 5 in the textbook, paying attention to the class slides and
Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Please see the instructor or one of the teaching
assistants if you have questions these reading assignments.

\section*{Accessing the Practical Assignment on GitHub}

To access the practical assignment, you should go into the \channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find
the announcement that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into your web browser. Now, you should accept
the practical assignment and see that GitHub Classroom created a new GitHub repository for you to access the
assignment's starting materials and to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically, to access your new
repository for this assignment, please click the green ``Accept'' button and then click the link that is prefaced with
the label ``Your assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly followed these steps,
you should have created a repository with a name like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-302-Spring-2019/computer-science-302-spring-2019-practical-5-gkapfham''. Unless you provide
the course instructor with documentation of the extenuating circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the
assignment means that you automatically receive a failing grade for it.

Before you move to the next step of this assignment, please make sure that you read all of the content on the web site
for your new GitHub repository, paying close attention to the technical details about the commands that you will type
and the output that your program must produce. Now you are ready to download the starting materials to your laboratory
computer. Click the ``Clone or download'' button and, after ensuring that you have selected ``Clone with SSH'', please
copy this command to your clipboard. To enter your course directory you should now type \command{cd cs302S2019}. Next,
you can type the command \command{ls} and see that there are files or directories inside of this directory. By typing
\command{git clone} in your terminal and then pasting in the string that you copied from the GitHub site you will
download all of the code for this assignment. For instance, if the course instructor ran the \command{git clone} command
in the terminal, it would look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-302-S2019/computer-science-302-spring-2019-practical-5-gkapfham.git
\end{lstlisting}

After this command finishes, you can use \command{cd} to change into the new directory. What files and directories do
you see? What do you think is their purpose? Please ask questions if you have any!

\section*{Repairing Mistakes in the HTML and CSS for a Web Site}

This practical assignment invites you to repair a web site that contains
incorrect HTML and CSS source code. You should use the \command{htmlhint
src/www/index.html} command and the GatorGrader tool to identify and fix all of
the mistakes in the provided source code files. Figure~\ref{fig:correct} gives
some examples of how the correct source code should look in the provided files.
Please remember that a ``linting'' tool is unlikely to point out all of the
problems in the source code --- you will need to study the provided source code
and your textbook to carefully determine the root cause of each defect. For
example, you should check that the HTML tags match and the CSS rules are
correct.

Now, you are ready to practice running a web server to make your web site
available in a browser. You can now run your web server by typing the command
\command{serve src/www 4250}. At this point, you can start your web browser and
go to the web site \url{http://localhost:4250/}. Does your new web site look
correct? Can you see the required table? Are all of the styles and fonts
correctly applied? If not, then continue to edit and convert it until the files
are correct. Since this is a challenging practical assignment and you are still
learning how to debug complex HTML and CSS files, don't become frustrated if you
make a mistake. Instead, use your mistakes as an opportunity for learning both
about the necessary web development technology and the background and expertise
of the other students in the class, the teaching assistants, and the course
instructor.

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Web Site}

The Markdown file that contains your reflection must adhere to the standards
described in the Markdown Syntax Guide
\url{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}. Finally, your
\mainprogram{} file should adhere to the HTML standards established by the
\step{HTML linting} tool available at \url{http://htmlhint.com/}. Instead of
requiring you to manually check that your deliverables adhere to these
industry-accepted standards, the GatorGrader tool that you will use in this
practical assignment makes it easy for you to automatically check if your
submission meets the standards for correctness. For instance, GatorGrader will
check to ensure that \mainprogram{} creates a styled table with three columns, a
header, four rows, and an alternating background. With that said, remember that
these tools may not support the detection of all of the ten seeded defects!

To get started with the use of GatorGrader, type the command \gatorgraderstart{}
in your terminal window. If you have mistakes in your assignment, then you will
need to review GatorGrader's output, find the mistake, and try to fix it. Once
your program is building correctly, fulfilling at least some of the assignment's
requirements, you should transfer your files to GitHub using the \gitcommit{}
and \gitpush{} commands. For example, if you want to signal that the
\mainprogramsource{} file has been changed and is ready for transfer to GitHub
you would first type \gitcommitmainprogram{} in your terminal, followed by
typing \gitpush{} to perform the transfer. Please see the instructor if you
cannot use GitHub.

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system
called Travis CI, when you use the \gitpush{} command to transfer your source
code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of your
assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your
source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you will
see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile. If
your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear
instead. The instructor will reduce a student's grade for this assignment if the
red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last commit
in your GitHub repository, then you satisfied all of the main checks, thereby
allowing the course instructor to evaluate other aspects of your source code and
writing, as further described in the \step{Evaluation} section of this
assignment sheet. Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the
extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered
towards your grade for this practical assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical
writing for any assignment in this course. Instead, this assignment invites you
to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\begin{enumerate}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item A properly formatted and correct version of \mainprogramsource{} that both
  meets all of the established requirements and produces the correct HTML and
  the desired static web site.

\item A properly formatted and correct version of all of the CSS files (e.g.,
  \program{site.css} and \program{table.css}) that correctly style the HTML tags
  and produce a web site meeting the requirements.

\item A screenshot of your final web page, stored in the file
  \mainimagesource{}, that shows the final graphical layout of your page and
  demonstrates all of the required features.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Practical Assignment}

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in GitHub, you will privately received a grade
on this assignment and feedback on your submitted deliverables. Your grade for the assignment will be a function of the
whether or not it was submitted in a timely fashion and if your program received a green \checkmark{} indicating that it
met all of the requirements. Other factors will also influence your final grade on the assignment. In addition to
studying the efficiency and effectiveness of your Markdown source code, the instructor will also evaluate the accuracy of
both your writing and the constructs in your source code. If your submission receives a red \naughtmark{}, the
instructor will reduce your grade for the assignment while still considering the regularity with which you committed to
your GitHub repository and the overall quality of your partially completed work. Please see the instructor if you have
questions about the evaluation of this practical assignment.

% \section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

% In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
% for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
% carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
% assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., HTML source code or
% Markdown-based technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating
% the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor if you have questions about this policy.
