\section*{Objectives}

To learn how to write HTML and CSS files that include headers, content, tags,
style rules, and a form, specifically implementing your own form-based survey
that is suitable for a classroom setting. As the specific focus of this
assignment, you will program a bespoke HTML form featuring several integrated
form control elements, ultimately creating a survey that will use Formspree.io
to provide a response by email. Finally, you will continue to practice running a
web server and using automated tools, like GatorGrader and \program{htmlhint},
to assess your completion of the assignment.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Use the laboratory computers}. The computers in this laboratory feature specialized software for completing
  this course's laboratory and practical assignments. If it is necessary for you to work on a different machine, be sure
  to regularly transfer your work to a laboratory machine so that you can check its correctness. If you cannot use a
  laboratory computer and you need help with the configuration of your own laptop, then please carefully explain its
  setup to a teaching assistant or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a teaching assistant or instructor what assignment
  step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the start of a laboratory or practical session
  and then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can
  post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with a teaching assistant or
  the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Starting with this practical assignment, you will be responsible for storing
  all of your files (e.g., JavaScript code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub Classroom.
  Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that
  everything is updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established correctness requirements by
  using the provided checking tools on your local computer and in checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files, and written reports after you submit them
  through GitHub; you will need them again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. All of your files are regularly backed-up to the servers in the Department of
  Computer Science and, if you commit your files regularly, stored on GitHub. However, you may want to use a flash
  drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep an extra copy of your files on reserve. In the event of
  any type of system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have access to a recent backup copy of all your
  files.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the practical assignments will be challenging
  for you, each part is designed to give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of computer
  science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed at a wide variety of companies. To explore and
  develop new ideas, you should regularly communicate with your team and/or the teaching assistants and tutors.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments require to you write technical
  documentation and descriptions of your experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct, remembering that computer scientists must
  effectively communicate and collaborate with their team members and the tutors, teaching assistants, and course
  instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your
  assignments with others, copying source code or writing is a violation of
  Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub
Guides'', available at \url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use
many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, make sure that you
have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your Projects
on GitHub''; each of them will help you to understand how to use GitHub. To do
well on this assignment, you should also review Chapters 1 and 5 in the course
textbook, paying particularly close attention to Sections 5.3 through 5.5 and
Figures 5.18, 5.19, and 5.20. Importantly, for this practical assignment the
students is responsible for finding and reading all of the technical material
that they need to successfully design the requested web site. Please see the
course instructor or a teaching assistant if you have questions about these
reading assignments.

\section*{Accessing the Practical Assignment on GitHub}

To access the practical assignment, you should go into the
\channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find the announcement
that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into your web browser.
Now, you should accept the practical assignment and see that GitHub Classroom
created a new GitHub repository for you to access the assignment's starting
materials and to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically,
to access your new GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green
``Accept'' button and then click the link that is prefaced with the label ``Your
assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly
followed these steps, you should have created a repository with a name like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-302-Spring-2019/computer-science-302-spring-2019-practical-6-gkapfham''.
Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means that you
automatically receive a failing grade for it.

Before you move to the next step of this assignment, please make sure that you
read all of the content on the web site for your new GitHub repository, paying
close attention to the technical details about the commands that you will type
and the content that must be evident in your web site. Now you are ready to
download the starting materials to your laboratory computer. Click the ``Clone
or download'' button and, after ensuring that you have selected ``Clone with
SSH'', please copy this command to your clipboard. To enter into your course
directory you should now type \command{cd cs302S2019}. Now, by typing
\command{git clone} in your terminal and then pasting in the string that you
copied from the GitHub site you will download all of the code for this
assignment. For instance, if the course instructor ran the \command{git clone}
command in the terminal, it would look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-302-S2019/computer-science-302-spring-2019-practical-6-gkapfham.git
\end{lstlisting}

After this command finishes, you can use \command{cd} to change into the new
directory. If you want to \step{go back} one directory from your current
location, then you can type the command \command{cd ..}. Please continue to use
the \command{cd} and \command{ls} commands to explore the files that you
automatically downloaded from GitHub. What files and directories do you see? In
what ways will you have to extend them? Please note that this assignment
furnishes HTML and CSS files with minimal starting content. Spend some time
exploring these files, sharing your discoveries with the \mbox{course
instructor}.

\section*{Creating a Bespoke Interactive Survey with an HTML Form}

This practical assignment invites you to implement a web site, using the HTML
and CSS programming languages, that contains a bespoke, form-based survey that
is suitable for a classroom setting. Specifically, you will identify your own
topic for investigation and then program a form containing all of the needed
form control elements. Please refer to your GitHub repository for the details
concerning all of the components that your web site must contain. With that
said, it is important to note that your web site must use Formspree to control
the submission of the form's data to your email address. Also, your form must
contain certain useful elements such as text fields, text areas, radio buttons,
checkboxes, and a submit button.
%
You should also ensure that your survey contains sections of supporting content,
organized in correctly styled lists and tables, that provide context for your
survey's purpose.
%
In addition to talking with the course instructor, students who are not sure how
to create a form containing these types of elements should refer to a previous
assignment, the textbook, additional online resources, and their course notes.

As you complete this practical assignment, you should regularly commit files to
your GitHub repository, using the ``Git Cheat Sheet'' and the steps that you
used in previous assignments and that are reviewed in the next section. Also,
note that your web server will require a dedicated terminal when it is running.
Students should also remember to check the correctness of their HTML by running
the command \command{htmlhint src/www/index.html} in their terminal window. If
the web site displays incorrectly, please discuss the problems with a teaching
assistant or the instructor.

Remember, you can run your web server by typing the command \command{serve
src/www 4250}. At this point, you can start your browser and go to the site
\url{http://localhost:4250/}. Please check to see if your web site looks
correct. If it is not, then continue to edit and check it until the files are
correct. You should also ensure that, when you run the web server, it produces
output suggesting that it is returning three CSS files and an image. If not,
then please make sure that you revise your HTML source code and/or check the
configuration of your web server. Specifically, please make sure that your web
server is returning the correct CSS files that contain the styles for your HTML.
Finally, when you are interacting with your web site you should verify the
correctness of all components (e.g., certain links may need to open in a new
browser tab and the form should contain all of the required components for the
interactive survey that reports by email using Formspree).

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Web Site}

Instead of requiring you to manually check that your deliverables adhere to the
industry-accepted standards for web site programming, the GatorGrader tool that
you will use in this practical assignment makes it easy for you to
automatically check if your submission meets the standards for correctness. For
instance, GatorGrader will check to ensure that \mainprogram{} has the required
sections and an interactive survey with the expected number of form elements.

To get started with the use of GatorGrader, type the command \gatorgraderstart{}
in your terminal window. If you have mistakes in your assignment, then you will
need to review GatorGrader's output, find the mistake, and try to fix it. Once
your program is building correctly, fulfilling at least some of the assignment's
requirements, you should transfer your files to GitHub using the \gitcommit{}
and \gitpush{} commands. For example, if you want to signal that the
\mainprogramsource{} file has been changed and is ready for transfer to GitHub
you would first type \gitcommitmainprogram{} in your terminal, followed by
typing \gitpush{} to perform the transfer. Please see the instructor if you
cannot use GitHub.

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system
called Travis CI, when you use the \gitpush{} command to transfer your source
code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of your
assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your
source code and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you will
see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile. If
your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear
instead. The instructor will reduce a student's grade for this assignment if the
red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last commit
in your GitHub repository, then you satisfied all of the main checks, thereby
allowing the course instructor to evaluate other aspects of your source code and
writing, as further described in the \step{Evaluation} section of this
assignment sheet. Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the
extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered
towards your grade for this practical assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical
writing for any assignment in this course. Instead, this assignment invites you
to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables. Remember, this practical
assignment does not submitted web site to match a screenshot provided in your
GitHub repository. Instead, you are responsible for making a site that meets the
baseline requirements. Please see the course instructor if you have questions
about this assignment's goals.

\begin{enumerate}

  \setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item A properly formatted and correct version of \mainprogramsource{} that both
  meets all of the established requirements and contains the correct HTML and
  the desired static web site.

\item All of the other necessary source code (e.g., CSS files) and auxiliary
  files (e.g., images) that you need to completely implement an interactive
  survey suitable for a classroom setting.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Practical Assignment}

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in
GitHub, you will privately received a grade on this assignment and feedback on
your submitted deliverables. Your grade for the assignment will be a function of
the whether or not it was submitted in a timely fashion and if your program
received a green \checkmark{} indicating that it met all of the requirements.
Other factors will also influence your final grade on the assignment. In
addition to studying the efficiency and effectiveness of your Markdown and/or
HTML source code, the instructor will also evaluate the accuracy of both your
writing and the constructs in your source code. But, if your submission receives
a red \naughtmark{}, then you will not receive the completion grade for this
practical assignment. Please see the course instructor if you have questions
about the evaluation of this practical assignment.

\section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an
individual basis. While it is appropriate for students in this class to have
high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem
with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or
merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., HTML source code
or Markdown-based technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of
others will be taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see
the course instructor if you have questions about this policy.
